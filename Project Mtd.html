The base of this method lies in the philosophy of pragmatism. This method emphasizes on building a comprehensive unit around an activity which may be carried out in school or outside. The essence of this method lies in the fact that a group of students do a purposeful task. This implies the students undertake the activity in a group or individually over a period of time. It may include a number of activities and the end product is in the form of written report or a display. “A project is a whole-hearted purposeful activity proceeding in a social environment”- Dr. William Kilpatrick.</p><p>“A project is a problematic act carried to completion in its natural setting”. – Stevenson.</p><p> “A project is a bit of real life that has been imported into school. – Ballard.</p><p>Thus, project is a purposeful activity and planned activity which is achieved in social, natural situations created in schools.</p><p><br></p></div>

                        <p>1.	<strong>PROVIDING A SITUATION</strong><br>The teacher provides a situation to the students which must create same problems and students must feel interested to work.<br>2.	<strong>CHOOSING AND PURPOSING</strong><br>The students are tempted to choose a project. The teacher should stimulate discussion by suggestion. While choosing the project the teacher should bear in need that it should be of real need to students. The purpose of project must be clearly defined to the students. The project must be common and acceptable to all. In case of wrong choosing, teacher must help students tactfully to see that the students choose a better project. They should be asked to write down the reasons for selection.<br>3.	<strong>PLANNING</strong><br>The success of the project lies in the good planning. The students should plan out the whole project under the guidance of a teacher. Every child must be encouraged to participate in the discussion and make suggestion. All the students are encouraged to write down the plan neatly and properly.<br>4.<strong>	EXECUTING</strong><br>Execution of different activities to different students on the basis of their capacity leads to successful completion of the project work. It is the longest step and requires meticulous assignment of duties to different students or groups. The teacher must guide and encourage students. It is the duty of the teacher to keep watch on the process of activities and instruct as and when required<br>&nbsp;<strong>EVALUATION</strong><br>This is very important step as; the students review the project and find out mistakes if any. Self-Criticism is very important at this stage. The students discuss their work and rectify their mistakes and recollect useful knowledge. The teacher sees that the objectives of the project have been achieved.<br>&nbsp;<strong>RECORDING</strong><br>The students keep a complete record of entire activity. How they planned, how discussions were held, how duties are assigned, how criticism were made, which will help them in their future work.<br></p>

                        <p>1)	It promotes Co-operative activity.<br>2)	It arouses and maintains interest of students.<br>3)	It keeps the students on freedom of thought and action while doing the work.<br>4)	It develops scientific attitude.<br>5)	It widens the mental horizon of student.<br>6)	It develops dignity of labour.<br>7)	The students learn by self activity.<br>8)	It supports all the laws of learning i.e., law of readiness, law of exercise, law of effect.<br>9)	The correlation of subjects is best followed in this method. The subjects are not treated as water tight compartments.<br>10)	This is a psychological method.<br><br><strong>DEMERITS OF PROJECT METHOD</strong><br>1.	The knowledge is not acquired in a sequential manner.<br>2.	There may be a chance of overlapping of subject matter.<br>3.	If not planned and executed properly them, it may not be completed in time.<br>4.	It is a time consuming process.<br>5.	It may be a costly affair where in same items/things may not be available at times.<br>6.	There may be overdevelopment of individualism and under development of co-operation and group responsibility.<br>7.	If the topic in wrongly selected them the objective may not be achieved.<br>8.	It gives to students a superficial knowledge of great many things. Therefore it is not suitable for all types of students.<br>9.	This method is not suitable for a mature teacher.<br>10.	The whole syllabus, for higher classes cannot be accomplished with this method.<br><br><strong>SUGGESTIONS TO IMPROVE</strong><br>1.	The topic should have same educational value.<br>2.	Project should be selected according to the student’s interest.<br>3.	Entire course should not be planned only using this method.<br>4.	The objectives of the project must be clear and defined.<br>5.	Students should be assigned various duties according to their capabilities.<br>6.	The students should be given freedom to interact among themselves.<br></p>
